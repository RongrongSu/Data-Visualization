# Online news popularity analysis
In this project, I intend to analysis if an article will become popular or not by using features like type of content, number of images/videos , the day on which the paper was published, etc. The data set from UCI website summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. Dataset consists of 61 attributes: 58 predictive attributes, 2 non-predictive, 1 goal field.

# House price analysis
In this project, I try to describe the relationship between house price and variables such as garage quanlity, basement quality and pool quality. In brief, this project includes two parts: feature engineering and building models to predict sale price of a house. The data set contains 1460 records and 81 variables. Among 81 variables, there are character and integer variables and the last variable (SalePrice) is the response variable.
